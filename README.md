# MIMO-OFDM-VLC
This repository contains MATLAB file for simulating performance of different OFDM-based VLC system
It can also be used for integration of adaptive modulation schemes such as PPM/MPPM with OFDM-VLC. 
It has also the featured the MIMO for indoor flat fading optical channel in DCO-OFDM
